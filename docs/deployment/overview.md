# Deployment Overview

This document provides an overview of the deployment architecture and processes for this monorepo.

## Architecture

This project uses:
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipelines
- **Vercel** for hosting and preview deployments
- **Turborepo** for monorepo build orchestration

## Applications

The monorepo contains multiple Next.js applications:

- **`apps/web`** - Main IdeaI web application
  - Production: https://www.myui.space
  - Serves sub-apps at `/apps/{name}` via catch-all route
- **`apps/docs`** - IdeaI documentation site
  - Deployed as standalone Vercel project
  - Deployed as standalone Vercel project
- **`apps/all`, `apps/nocss`, `apps/mvp`, `apps/tailwind`, `apps/allcss`** - CSS showcase apps
  - Ready for deployment

All apps share components from `@repo/ui` and can be deployed using `./deploy.sh --prod`.

See [Unified Deployment Guide](./unified-deployment.md) for deployment instructions.

## Deployment Environments

### Preview
- **Trigger**: Push to `preview` branch or pull requests
- **URL**: Automatically generated preview URLs
- **Purpose**: Testing and review before production

### Production
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **URL**: Production domain
- **Purpose**: Live production environment

## Deployment Methods

### Automatic (Recommended)
Deployments happen automatically via GitHub Actions when:
- Code is pushed to `preview` or `main` branches
- Pull requests are created/updated

### Manual
Deployments can be triggered manually using the unified deployment script:

```bash
# Deploy all apps to production
./deploy.sh --prod

# Deploy specific apps
./deploy.sh --prod docs web

# Preview deployment
./deploy.sh
```

See [Unified Deployment Guide](./unified-deployment.md) for complete instructions.
